# My-Single-page-CV

This repo contains the basic structure of my website. HTML, CSS and some pics are the things you will find here. Dockerfile was added recently along with a default.conf 

Build an image from Dockerfile and run it. 

-> docker build -t<tag> -f<file> 

-> docker run -p 8000:8000 <image:tag>
